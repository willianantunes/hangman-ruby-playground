# Hangman Ruby Playground

First of all I'm playing with Rails to discover how it works with random approaches. When I reach the point where I can do things as I desire, this will provide me everything I need to create the Hangman Man through an API! Keep looking on it! :smiley:

## Running the project

At the root folder, execute the following:

    bundler install
    
Having `rails` globally installed, now you can do:

    rails db:migrate && rails server

With `HTTPie` (or `curl`) you can play with it:

    http :3000/todos
    http POST :3000/todos title=Mozart created_by=1
    http PUT :3000/todos/1 title=Beethoven
    http DELETE :3000/todos/1

In order to run tests:

    bundle exec rspec

## What I learned so far

### Creating the project

After issuing `gem install rails`, at the root folder I did:

    rails new . --skip-git --skip-action-mailer --skip-action-mailbox \
    --skip-action-text --skip-active-storage --skip-test --api

Important things:

- I had to exclude `public` folder and its content (in my case, only `robots.txt`), as I'm developing an [API-only application](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html);
- As you saw, I used `--skip-test` because I configured RSpec afterwards.

### Creating models and migrations

If you worked with [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli) or [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/migrations/) concerning this topic, here you'll see the same thing but with a different approach. Like your model has no explicit attributes, only validations for example. You can only see its attributes analyzing [schema.rb](/db/schema.rb). So I understand a good way to work with it is first you generate you model, like the following:

    rails g model Player name:string email:string birthday:date gender:string

This will generate the following files (I'm using `RSpec`):

    db/migrate/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_players.rb
    app/models/player.rb
    spec/models/player_spec.rb

You can edit the migration `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_players.rb` and leave like that:

```ruby
class CreatePlayers < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table :players do |t|
      t.string :name, limit: 70, null: false
      t.string :email, limit: 320, null: false
      t.date :birthday
      t.string :gender, limit: 1

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Then you can run `rails db:migrate` and it's all done.

Important: You can't keep all the generating models process from the command line, that mean that you have to alter the migration file for some tasks like configure a column as not null, default value and some other configuration.


Concerning my hangman modeling, I created executing the following commands:

    rails g model Player name:string{70} email:string{320} birthday:date gender:string{1}
    rails g model Game in_progress:boolean defined_word:string{45} attempts:integer perfect_victory:boolean number_of_tries:integer current_situation:string player:belongs_to
    rails g model Guess chosen_letter:string{1} winner:boolean game:belongs_to
    rails g model Hit word_position:integer guess:belongs_to

I had to edit some files, for example I updated `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_create_games.rb` in order to not allow the same player create a game with a previous word he used including some other constraints:

```ruby
class CreateGames < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    create_table :games do |t|
      t.boolean :in_progress, default: true, null: false
      t.string :defined_word, limit: 45, null: false
      t.integer :attempts, null: false
      t.boolean :perfect_victory
      t.integer :number_of_tries, default: 0
      t.string :current_situation, null: false
      t.belongs_to :player, null: false, foreign_key: true

      t.timestamps
    end

    add_index(:games, [:defined_word, :player_id], unique: true)
  end
end
```
