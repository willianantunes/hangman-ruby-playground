# Hangman Ruby Playground

First of all I'm playing with Rails to discover how it works with random approaches. When I reach the point where I can do things as I desire, this will provide me everything I need to create the Hangman Man through an API! Keep looking on it! :smiley:

## Running the project

At the root folder, execute the following:

    bundler install
    
Having `rails` globally installed, now you can do:

    rails server

With `HTTPie` (or `curl`) you can play with it:

    http :3000/todos
    http POST :3000/todos title=Mozart created_by=1
    http PUT :3000/todos/1 title=Beethoven
    http DELETE :3000/todos/1

In order to run tests:

    bundle exec rspec

## Creating the project

After issuing `gem install rails`, at the root folder I did:

    rails new . --skip-git --skip-action-mailer --skip-action-mailbox \
    --skip-action-text --skip-active-storage --skip-test --api

Important things:

- I had to exclude `public` folder and its content (in my case, only `robots.txt`), as I'm developing an [API-only application](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/api_app.html);
- As you saw, I used `--skip-test` because I configured RSpec afterwards.
